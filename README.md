# Understanding Unix/Linux Programming
Bruce Molay

I am reading through each chapter in the text book. I will try and write
working C code for -
* each example program
* every programming exercise and project

For each of the example programs shown in the book, I have made my own changes
and improvements.

My coding standards -
* Whenever I include header files from the standard library, I comment as to
the main reason why I need them.
* Always use curly bracers to enclose one-line code for conditional and loop 
statements.
